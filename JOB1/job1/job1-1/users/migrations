The migrations directory is typically used to store migration files generated by Django when you make changes to your models. Since this is a new project and no migrations have been created yet, the directory will be empty. 

Here is the content for the file:

# /job1/job1/users/migrations/__init__.py
# This file is intentionally left blank.

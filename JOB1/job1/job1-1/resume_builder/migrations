The migrations directory for the `resume_builder` app is typically where Django stores migration files that track changes to the models. Since this is a new app and no migrations have been created yet, the directory will be empty. 

Here is the content for the file:

/job1/job1/resume_builder/migrations
# This directory is intentionally left blank.

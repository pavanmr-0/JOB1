### `render.yaml`
Tells Render how to build and run your app:
- Environment: Python 3
- Build command: Install → Collect statics → Migrate
- Start command: Gunicorn
- Auto-deploys on git push

### `build.sh`
Executed during deployment:
- Installs Python packages
- Collects static files
- Runs database migrations

### `Procfile`
Defines processes for any platform:
- Web process: Gunicorn
- Release phase: Database migrations

### `requirements.txt`
Lists all Python packages needed:
- Django and frameworks
- Production server (Gunicorn)
- Static file handler (WhiteNoise)
- Database support (PostgreSQL)

### `.env.example`
Template showing environment variables needed:
- DEBUG, SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS
- DATABASE_URL (for PostgreSQL)
- Serves as documentation

### `job1/settings.py`
Django configuration that:
- Reads environment variables
- Switches database based on environment
- Enables production security
